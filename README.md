Startup project for CS 260

I clone trashy China cats.
Not really. But the cool thing is, if you mix up all the letters in that sentence, you can spell out my full name.  Imagine a website where you could just type in your name, or maybe someone else’s name, or any word or sentence really, and find out what else those letters would spell! That’s what my startup is all about: anagrams. I’m not saying they’ll be very good, but we’ll find you one if there is one. On the website, you’ll enter some letters and it’ll give you an anagram. You’ll be able to log in, save your favorite ones for later, send the good ones to your buddies (or your grandma), and maybe even more!
Features:
-	Secure login over HTTPS
-	It’ll give you an anagram
-	You can save your favorites
-	User-friendly display
-	You can send the ones you want to
-	Potential guess-the-word games

HTML:
    Separate it into sections even though you don't necessarily have to, since it'll give the webpage more structure and help out with organization and non-visual functionality.

Changing the website once it's up:
    1. Make the changes you want.
    2. Push them to github
    3. pull them to the amazon console
    4. deploy them using the deployment script
