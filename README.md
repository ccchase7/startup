Startup project for CS 260

Github assignment:
    Github allows me to have several versions of my code and to go back to whichever one I want to when I need to.  It also allows me to mix different versions or changes and end up with just one version.  I think it is really nifty that I can do it all from VS Code and it's all hooked up already.  I also learned that I'll have to review the changes when there is a conflict between two commits, and that there are a lot of checks to make sure I really want to be committing all the stuff that I end up putting up there.
